Nothing to see here.

This file is an expression of my lack of motivation to make Mkdocs work better with ReadTheDocs. It sits there only to separate a bit more the API section from the rest of the doc.

The API class list is at "top level" (actually second level) and does not fold, because no more than 2 file-levels are supported by the theme provided by ReadTheDocs. If the class files were placed at third level, folding works for them, but breaks the rest of the nav.

Allowing custom themes on ReadTheDocs could allow to fix it, but it's [officially not supported](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/978#issuecomment-285212453).
I considered switching to Sphinx, but it's too complicated in comparison to Mkdocs. Switching all the existing docs and scripts to use ReStructuredText is also a lot of work. Sphinx claims to support Markdown too but my attempts at using it failed.

So for now... have a bit of space.
